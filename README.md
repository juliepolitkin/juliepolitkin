# Hi, I’m Julie Politkin 👋

I’m a freelance web developer who’s been exploring the digital world for 20 years — and now I’m bringing all that passion into professional, clean, scalable websites.

🌐 I use **HTML, CSS, and Tailwind** to build responsive layouts that grow with your business   
🧩 I care deeply about clean structure, pixel-perfect details, and websites that *feel right*   
🛠️ I’m currently crafting a minimalist, Tailwind-powered theme for ClassicPress   
🚀 Always learning, always building — especially when it comes to **scalable web systems**
